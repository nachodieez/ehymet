	abstract = {In the context of functional data analysis, we propose new sample tests for homogeneity. Based on some well-known depth measures, we construct four different statistics in order to measure distance between the two samples. A simulation study is performed to check the efficiency of the tests when confronted with shape and magnitude perturbation. Finally, we apply these tools to measure the homogeneity in some samples of real data, and we obtain good results using this new method.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a clustering procedure for samples of multivariate functions in \$\$(L{\textasciicircum}2(I)){\textasciicircum}\{J\}\$\$, with \$\$J{\textbackslash}ge 1\$\$. This method is based on a k-means algorithm in which the distance between the curves is measured with a metric that generalizes the Mahalanobis distance in Hilbert spaces, considering the correlation and the variability along all the components of the functional data. The proposed procedure has been studied in simulation and compared with the k-means based on other distances typically adopted for clustering multivariate functional data. In these simulations, it is shown that the k-means algorithm with the generalized Mahalanobis distance provides the best clustering performances, both in terms of mean and standard deviation of the number of misclassified curves. Finally, the proposed method has been applied to two case studies, concerning ECG signals and growth curves, where the results obtained in simulation are confirmed and strengthened.},
